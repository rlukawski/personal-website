        A full-stack developer with 5+ years of modern frontend/backend
        experience and 20+ years in IT. I'm passionate about the entire software
        development lifecycle—from system architecture through implementation to
        production deployment. Leading cross-functional teams and delivering
        robust, scalable solutions gives me as much satisfaction as writing
        clean, maintainable code.
