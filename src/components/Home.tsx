            A full-stack developer with 5+ years of modern frontend/backend
            experience and 20+ years in IT. I'm passionate about the entire
            software development lifecycle—from system architecture through
            implementation to production deployment. Leading cross-functional
            teams and delivering robust, scalable solutions gives me as much
            satisfaction as writing clean, maintainable code. Google Cloud
