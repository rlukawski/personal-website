          A full-stack developer with 5+ years of modern frontend/backend
          experience and 20+ years in IT. I'm passionate about the entire
          software development lifecycle—from system architecture through
          implementation to production deployment. Leading cross-functional
          teams and delivering robust, scalable solutions gives me as much
          satisfaction as writing clean, maintainable code.
